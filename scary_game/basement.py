        You investigate the main floor to find the only closed door. You think it might be a broom closet, but you open
        it anyway. You find a winding, dusty, staircase leading to the basement. There is no light, but you find an electrical wire
        snaking its way on the wall. You can't find an outlet, but you assume that there will be a switch at the bottom of the stairs. \n
        With your right hand on the railing, you lead the way down to the basement in hopes of finding what you are searching for. \n
        You were right about the light switch. You flick it on, and for a breif moment light illuminates the room before the very old bulb shatters. \n
        You aren't sure if you saw a figure in the breif moment that the lights were on, or if it was just your imagination. Since this is the age of
        technology, everyone in your party gets out their cellphones to illuminate the room. The room is still shrouded in shadow, but it is just bright
        enough to make out the objects in the room. \n
